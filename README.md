## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] An Express server that only returns JSON

- [ ] Endpoints for creating, reading, updating & deleting resources
- [ ] Token-based authentication so only the owner of a resource can change it
- [ ] Correct headers and response metadata
- [ ] Error-handling to make it easy to use the API to build something
- [ ] Tests for server routes and database access
- [ ] Not process user input as SQL commands
- [ ] Hidden environment variables (i.e. not on GitHub)
